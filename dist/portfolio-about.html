                Who is Chad Fraser?
            </h1>
            <p class="about-intro-text">
                I've always struggled with this question before. It's not that I don't know who I am, but it's very
                hard for anyone to recite interesting facts about themselves on the spot. It's even more difficult
                to really zero in on what it is that makes us 'ourselves', and what's just filler in our identity.
                What sets us apart from everyone else? What is fundamental to who we are? What's just background noise,
                and what's really <em>important</em> in our lives?
                <br>
                <br>
                I've thought long and hard about this question now, and I have finally come up with six things that I
                think strike the core of the question "Who is Chad Fraser?".

                            a proud McGill graduate.</h1>
                        <p>
                            After graduating high school, I was fortunate enough to be accepted into the beautiful
                            and prestigious McGill University in Montreal, Quebec. Some of the best friendships I've
                            ever had were made at McGill, and attending this university offered me countless events
                            and adventures that I could never have experienced otherwise. Being immersed in a culture
                            as unique and fascinating as Montreal's is an opportunity I will never regret having taken.
                            It took a lot of hard work and struggle to graduate from McGill University, but it is one
                            of my proudest accomplishments, and one I will never forget.

                            <br>
                            improvisational.</h1>
                        <p>
                            I pride myself on my professional and hard-working attitude, but that doesn't mean that
                            I don't know how to cut back and have fun! I was a member of the McGill University improv
                            team during my time studying there. Unfortunately, scheduling conflicts with other clubs
                            meant that I had to reluctantly leave the team only a couple years in. Even so, there was
                            nothing that could ever begin compare to the feeling of crafting a spontaneous story with
                            my teammates!
                            <br> <br>
                            There's no better way to pump up a team and bring some energy into a room than with improv
                            exercises and games. It's one of the few arts where the entire scene falling apart around
                            you can be just as much fun as everything going perfectly to plan, and the spirit and soul
                            of improv will always be a part of my core identity.

                            a board game fanatic!</h1>
                        <p>
                            Ever since I was a kid, I have loved playing board games with my friends! Of course, none of
                            my high-school-aged friends had a very expansive games catalog: When we played, it would
                            often be Settlers of Catan, Risk, Clue, or else a trading card game.
                            <br> <br>
                            But early into my first year at McGill University, I joined its small student-run board
                            games club. This opened my eyes to how truly diverse and exciting the world of board gaming
                            was. They had nearly a hundred games at the club, and every now and then a member would
                            bring in a new one to share with everybody there. It was an amazing experience to be able to
                            explore so many games!
                            <br> <br>
                            I volunteered to take the position of the board game club's secretary the first week that I
                            joined the club. Even though there were fewer than ten regular members when I first joined,
                            we had several dozen regular members by the time I graduated years later, and I will forever
                            be grateful that I had the opportunity to play so many different kinds of games with all
                            of them.
                            <br> <br>
                            Some of my favorite games include:

                            an avid mahjong* player.</h1>
                        <p>
                            I had been intrigued and fascinated by the concept of mahjong ever since I came across it
                            in some of the comics I had read as a teenager. As soon as I learned that the university
                            I attended had a student-run mahjong club, I jumped at the chance to join. It is by far
                            one of my favorite games, and I still spend a lot of my free time playing online
                            Japanese-style mahjong (though I'm admittedly not very good at it!). I wrote a blog
                            dedicated to mahjong during my time as the university mahjong club's president, and have
                            countless fond memories of playing the game with my friends there.
                            <br> <br>
                            I own three mahjong sets in total (though one is missing a few tiles, unfortunately, and one
                            has transparent tiles for a gimmicky gameplay variation), and love teaching the game to new
                            players as much as I love playing it myself!
                            <br> <br>
                            One of my dreams is to find another group of eager and fun friends to play this beautiful
                            game with in-person, on a regular basis once more.
                            <br> <br> <br>

                    <h1>Chad Fraser is...
                        <br>
                        a teacher.</h1>
                        <p>
                            I am licensed and qualified to teach in two Canadian provinces: Both in Alberta, where I
                            grew up, and Quebec, where I studied in post-secondary schooling. Ever since I was young,
                            I had been fascinated with the subject of math, and what an exciting field it was.
                            There was so many interesting things you could do with it, and as a teenager, I loved
                            stumbling across fun (yet simple enough for me to understand!) quirks of math like the
                            Banach-Tarski paradox, or Cantor's diagonalization proof. It was honestly fun to learn about
                            all of these concepts!
                            <br> <br>
                            But even as a kid, it was clear to me that my classmates weren't nearly as enamored with
                            it as I was. Almost all of my friends struggled to pick up on the material that came to me
                            so easily. At first I started just helping my friends understand how to complete the
                            assigned worksheets during class, but the more I worked at helping them learn, the more I 
                            realized how enjoyable doing so was. It was great seeing how excited they got when something
                            clicked in their minds! Before too long, I was volunteering at the high school's tutoring
                            center and making some study guides for my friends before finals.
                            <br> <br>
                            This was when I first resolved to study education in university. The more I taught my
                            friends and tutored other students, the more I realized that a lot of these students were
                            bright kids that just weren't being taught in an effective way that would let them really
                            grasp the material. I wanted to help design and present methods of learning math that
                            students could relate to and understand on a deeper level.
                            <br> <br>
                            Though some of my passions may have changed over the years, my desire to help others find
                            new understandings is inherent to who I am.
