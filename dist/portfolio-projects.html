                        <p class="project-description">
                            Clu Clu Land is an arcade-style NES game, somewhat comparable to Pac-Man. Each level is
                            set up like a geoboard, with evenly spaced pegs sticking up out of the ground, some of which
                            are connected by rubber bands. On each stage, there is a hidden image made up of invisible
                            gold bars between the pegs. Your goal is to uncover the hidden image by moving your character
                            across each invisible gold bar.
                            <br> <br>
                            It's not that easy though! Sea urchins and black holes will kill your character with the
                            slightest contact, and your life count is limited. Additionally, your character constantly
                            moves forwards automatically, and you can't directly change her direction. All you can do is
                            stick your character's left or right arm out to the side to make her swing around a peg as
                            she passes it, and use the momentum of her swing to change her direction.
                            <br>
                            It's a lot harder than it sounds!
                            <br> <br>
                            This port I've made comes with a demo, remappable controls, new hidden images on each stage,
                            new items, and up to four-player simultaneous co-op play!

                            It can be tedious checking your favorite websites every morning, especially if you need to
                            check for any updates across dozens of pages (<em>Especially</em> especially when those
                            updates may be as small as a single number being changed).
                            <br> <br>
                            To run this program, just give it a list of user accounts from the RetroAchievements gaming
                            website that you want to track, as well as your email. Every time the program starts
                            tracking a new user (or game or game system), it scrapes the RetroAchievements website for
                            that user, then saves a JSON file with all of that user's relevant data (as well as a JSON
                            file for every game that user has saved in their history on the RetroAchievements website).
                            <br> <br>
                            Then, every future time the program is run, it compares the data in its stored JSON file
                            with the data currently on the RetroAchievements website. It compiles all updates from
                            every file it's tracking and emails you a formatted list of all of these updates.
                            <br> <br>
                            I found this very useful to make and use, since it allows me to know every time my friends
                            have played something new, or my favorite games have new challenges added to them.

                        A program that allows the player to play a game of four-player mahjong. The program so far
                        can play a full game in a console window against three computer AI opponents, handles scoring,
                        features rudimentary computer AI, and can recognize winning hands or legal moves according to
                        the Hong Kong Old Style Mahjong ruleset.
                        <br> <br>
                        In the future, I plan to give the program a graphical windowed mode, allow for the player to
                        select rulesets other than Hong Kong Old Style, separate out its scoring and AI system to
                        create mahjong calculator modes (e.g., showing the player how many points an arbitrary hand is
                        worth, or how many more turns at minimum a hand needs to win), and a more complex AI that takes
                        the scoring system into account.

                            size a set apart from one another.
